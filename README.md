# European_Clubs_Spending_Success

## Overview

In this project, I am going to analyze the top European Leagues and the list of clubs to understand is there a relationship
with their spendings, and trophy won.

Top 3 leagues I consider for the project
- La Liga
- Premier League
- Serie A

The following data is needed for the project
over the last 6 years with 2020 to be ignored as it was a pandemic year and consider an outlier
- club rankings 
- spending (mercato)
- european leagues won or participate (Europa League, Champions League)
